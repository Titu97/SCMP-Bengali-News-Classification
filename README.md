## Requirements

We recommend using Anaconda to manage dependencies. The code has been tested with Python 3.12.2 on NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs (80GB memory).

To set up the environment, create and activate a Conda environment using the following commands:

```
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate scmp
```
